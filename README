- Created a basic project with PIC16F616 and X8 as the compiler. That created this folder.
- Set Internal Oscillator:
  - Window > Pic Memory Views > Configuration Bits
  - Set FOSC to INTOSCCLK
  - Click Generate
  - Right click on "Header Files" in the project view. New C Header File > config.h
  - Paste the stuff from the output file into the main body (Line 15) of config.h (See checked in file)
- Create basic program
  - Right click on Source Files > New C Source File > main.c
  - Include config.h in main. Since it is in the project use "" instead of <>. <> is for things on the path (libraries).
  - Create main function. This is what is called as the entrypoint to a c program.
  - Click the hammer and make sure it compiles. You will see red if it doesn't. You can diff with this commit if you need to see what you have wrong.
  - Now we'll have a bunch of extra stuff in the directory. We should add these to .gitignore. Just check the file in this commit for what you need.
